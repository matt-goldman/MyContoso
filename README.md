# MyContoso

## Purpose

MyContoso is a contrived internal company app inspired by real enterprise systems.  
It is designed to demonstrate how client applications evolve under real delivery pressure, and how architectural decisions impact correctness, ownership, and maintainability over time.

The app intentionally includes:

*   Shared state
*   Isolated state
*   Navigation
*   Domain ownership
*   Cross-cutting concerns

## How to use this repo

This was created to support at talk at [MAUI Day](https://mauiday.net/), but you can get a feel for the arhcitectural learnings by viewing the branches in Sprint order (`sprint-1`, `spprint-2`, and `sprint-3`).

## Presentation

If you missed MAUIDay, the slides from the presentation are available in the root of the repo on the main brandh ([here](https://github.com/matt-goldman/MyContoso/blob/main/Opinionated%20by%20Necessity.pptx))
