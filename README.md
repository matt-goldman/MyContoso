# MyContoso

## Purpose

MyContoso is a contrived internal company app inspired by real enterprise systems.  
It is designed to demonstrate how client applications evolve under real delivery pressure, and how architectural decisions impact correctness, ownership, and maintainability over time.

The app intentionally includes:

*   Shared state
*   Isolated state
*   Navigation
*   Domain ownership
*   Cross-cutting concerns
